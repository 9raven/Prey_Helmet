# Prey_Helmet
Helmet from Arkane studios' Prey (google Arkane Prey Helmet, should be first image result)

I thought it looked cool, but in the game it is made with futuristic technology, so will first try to prototype a less sophisticated version. Could be used for cosplay??? Don't know if one exits yet.
Starting on Solidworks but will try to make some version on FreeCAD as well so that people don't have to pay to use it :)

Started some CAD, will try to make the mesh with 15 cm length equilateral triangles, planning to laser cut it from transparent acrylic, the mesh frame holding the acrylic elements will be 3D printed
Think of making them snap on hinges

Took some inspiration from Miura-Ori fold, could do something similar if outcome is a spherical surface. An arcing surface is indeed possible, know that from a paper, origami can be approximated
with the rigid panels with hinges.
